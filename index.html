                i live in a fairly cozy house in minneapolis, minnnesota with three eclectic roommates.  i am a vietnamese adoptee that loves the smell of seasons changing.  cold air always smells like memory, just like old paper books.  iâ€™m not very good with my words, so i tend to  resort to typed words.  i would like to say that i am inquisitive to a fault, have a persistent desire to learn, and am genuinely curious for why things are they way they are.  i think i am a hard worker but i do try not to take myself too seriously. i am also quite short and a terrible basketball player.  i've been told i'm a useless stump; however, what i lack in dribbling and free-throw skills though, i more than make up for my bodacious smile and personality, and my terrbile collection of dad jokes.

                i am a lover of love, a storyteller, and a random fact monger. but on a serious note, i value integrety and character. when i'm not lounging around on a sunday morning eating pancakes, i like to explore the spirit of fun in the greater outdoors by tackling the country by foot or on my all-city mancho man cyclocross bike; attemting to climb rocks; moonbeaming under the night sky; eating a plain raised glazed doughnut from bogart's doughtnuts-- best doughnut shop in the twin-cities; and getting my face lost in a stack of books. it makes me sad that i won't be able to read all the books that exist in the world but i hear some books royally suck. besides relishing in the things i enjoy day-by-day, there are things outside of myself that i am passionate about. join me on my mission to move people from disconnection toward connection away from our daily screens:
